to install:

  sudo python ./setup.py install

this will create a python library called 'rfidiot'.

*** note - if you are upgrading from a version that didn't use an install script,
and you've written your own clients, you'll need to make the following changes:

  replace all instances of 'RFIDIOTconfig' with 'rfidiot'

  e.g.

    import RFIDIOtconfig

  becomes

    import rfidiot

  and

    args= RFIDIOtconfig.args

  becomes

     args= rfidiot.args

  etc.
